# Reggie mode

Reggie mode doubles the speed of belts, crafting, inserters, bots, and so on.
It doesn't modify the game speed itself, so you still have 60 FPS/UPS.

This will make Factorio easier and more accessible, so even Reggie can enjoy playing it.

## Installation

Download and install from the [official Factorio mod
portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/reggie_mode).
